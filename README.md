# MyBoards
MyBoards is a React Native application for hangboard training. It is an always online app that uses the [MyBoards API]() to manage its data. I encourage pull requests if anyone is interested in further developing the platform. I'd like to one day have this app available to the wider public.   

**Technologies Used:**
- C# ASP.NET API 
- React Native Client
- Postgres SQL Database
