# MyBoards
MyBoards is a React Native application for hangboard training. 

# Desription
MyBoards is an always online app that uses the [MyBoards API](https://github.com/barnacleDevelopments/MyBoardsAPI) to manage its data. I encourage pull requests if anyone is interested in further developing the platform. I'd like to one day have this app available to the wider public. 

## Reason for Creating MyBoards
This application grew as a passion project while I was attending colledge. I wanted to create software that helped climbers become better at their craft. So I thought of creating a app for hangboard training would be a good start. 

### The Problem
Existing hangboard apps aren't flexible enough for climbers because they are blocking in nature. There are a few things that give them this quality. 
- Takes to long to create workouts.
- Pre-configured workouts are too easy or too hard for the individual.
- App takes to long to setup for a workout.
- Aren't suited for the individuals available equipment. 

### The Solution
I set out to create an app that solves these issues. 
- Auto-Generated workouts based on user workout performance.
- One click start 
- Can use any equipment available. 

These were hard problems to solve so I decided to start with customizability for equipment. 

# Setup
To setup this app for development you'll need (Android Studio)[https://developer.android.com/studio] and the [MyBoards API](https://github.com/barnacleDevelopments/MyBoardsAPI).

**Technologies Used:**
- React Native Client
